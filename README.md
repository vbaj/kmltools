# KML Tools
A standalone NWjs App for converting CSV files to KML Markup

>The current version is 1.0.0

The requirement of this package arose when vast GIS data from far flung places was needed for already delayed project. Only viable option was to collect it through normal men available on ground, who did not have any prior knowledge of GIS. Since the GIS application was under development, verification of so collected data was to be done on Google Earth and it was found easier to compile data in Excel Sheets instead of directly on Google Earth.

On Windows platform, Excel Sheet can also be used in addition to CSV.

## Requirements
MWjs 0.13 or later.
